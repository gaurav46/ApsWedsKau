<b>R. Nivedhitha, Student</b><br/><br/>I am one of those lucky students in Singapore, who learn playing the Electronic Keyboard under the able guidance of Mr Radha Vijayan at Mirra Fine Arts.. Indeed, I consider myself, very fortunate to have started my keyboard lessons under him.
<br><br>The very distinct advantage in learning under him is that I can learn 
both Indian Classical and Western Music on the Keyboard.<br><br> He is very committed 
and at the same time a very caring teacher, making it an enjoyable learning 
experience. I am sure that each &amp; every one of his students, gets great 
inspiration from the personal attention that he pays to their development along 
with commitment &amp; devotion which is the key to our success.<br><br>Once again, I would 
like to mention that I thoroughly enjoy learning both Indian Classical, as well 
as, Western music on the keyboard and I am very thankful to Mirra and my parents 
for making that happen. I wish to add here, that I would like to continue in the 
keyboard classes, for many years to come !

I started composing songs when I was 6 years old but I never knew how to
express it in black and white.  The day came when I met Viji uncle, I made him listen to my compositions.
He was happy but I felt that it is just not enough.  I wanted to get the discipline, music knowledge and experience which he
has till today !<br><br>
I really thank  Viji uncle for teaching me to play the Keyboard , to compose and arrange songs on the Computer and the opportunity to perform. Viji uncle is the best when it comes to teaching, he makes you feel mentally that the song is easy to play.
He often gives tips and tricks how to go about with the
songs.<br><br>

Well, all I  can say is that MIRRA FINE ARTS is best of the best !<br><br>

</b><br /><br />We can rarely find music schools that can make us want to practice instead of making us think that we need to practice. I had luck by chancing upon this one!
We play songs that we know  and love, and songs that we may never know but grow on us gradually.
Thank you Mirra! </p></td>

I wish I was a much younger guy and with more energy to learn every aspect

I realise I am able to learn and absorb only about 10% of what you are giving me. 
But even this 10% is giving me so much happiness which I would have missed 
if I had not started the course under your guidance.</p></td>

The teacher encouraged  till level 3 and with all his encouragement I passed my exam with distinction.  Mr. Radha Vijayan is a very jovial and sincere teacher.  I encourage you to go to Mirra Fine Arts and learn keyboard as music helps us to relax.".</p>

							I am happy to be a part of Mira Fine Arts family. 
                            Initially when I joined this school for the 
                            Electronic Keyboard Course, I was very much 
                            afraid whether I could cope up with the lessons. But 
                            in few months, I had the full confidence in me and I 
                            had the thirst to learn more and more in Music.&nbsp; 
                            All this happened due to the dedication and the way 
                            my teacher Mr. Radha Vijayan taught me.</p>

							I started my first music lessons at Mirra Fine Arts at the age of 15. It has been two years since I joined this school. In these years, I have truly enjoyed every moment I spent in the class. Each student is individually monitored and taught.
							<br/><br/>
							At Mirra Fine Arts, I have not only learned how to play the Keyboard, but also learnt how to appreciate and love music. According to me, Mirra Fine Arts is not a School, but a big family of music lovers. I would like to thank Mirra for making my life more colourful with music.

When I listen to songs now, there is a burning desire in me to play them in my guitar and I am doing it successfully now. For this I would have no one but my tutor Mr Radha Vijayan for inculcating the interest and helping me discover new horizons in music. The classes are definitely very informative and I have learnt a lot. Thank you Mirra Fine Arts....thank you Mr Radha Vijayan"</p></td>

Fortunately through one of my close friends I came to know about Mirra Fine Arts. As I was undergoing a hectic situation in my office as well as in my home, I realised that I needed an outlet to relieve my stress and get a feel of relaxation., and I found the answer was to learn Keyboard for Leisure and Fun at Mirra Fine Arts. Within a couple of months after joining Mirra, I felt that this is what I needed. Now the interest in learning the keyboard has developed to such an extent that I have taken up the Graded course for Trinity College of Music , London from Mirra Fine Arts. It makes me feel happy that I am dedicating 
                at least a part of my line for which I have been longing for all these  years. I wholeheartedly thank my Guru Sri Radha Vijayan for all his encouragement and guidance in learning this wonderful art.</p></td>
